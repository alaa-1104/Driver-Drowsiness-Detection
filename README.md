# Driver Drowsiness Detection

This project focuses on detecting driver drowsiness using computer vision and machine learning techniques.
The system aims to improve road safety by identifying signs of driver fatigue in real time.

## Project Overview
Driver drowsiness is one of the leading causes of road accidents.
This project detects signs of fatigue by analyzing facial features, such as eye closure,
and triggers an alert when drowsiness is detected.

## Features
- Real-time driver drowsiness detection
- Eye aspect ratio (EAR) analysis
- Works with camera or video input
- Visual alert when drowsiness is detected

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Dlib / MediaPipe
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
Due to GitHub size limitations, the dataset and trained models are not included in this repository
